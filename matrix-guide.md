# Matrix new user guide for TC39 delegates

1. Choose a client

    Like IRC and unlike many closed platforms, Matrix is an open protocol. Therefore, you can choose which client(s) you would prefer to use based on your preferred workflow.

    If you don't care too much and just want something that "works", we recommend [Element] (web, desktop and mobile).

    If you want to explore further or experiment with alternate clients, check out this [list of clients].

1. Create an account

    (Skip this step if you already have a Matrix account).

    1. Choose a homeserver

        Matrix is a federated service. Unlike IRC, you don't necessarily need to register on each server you want to talk on, you can register on any server you trust/like and talk everywhere else.

        We recommend using the officially maintained matrix.org homeserver, unless you have a reason to do otherwise. Matrix.org is the default on most clients. This is the server our channels are hosted on and a majority of delegates are registered to.

        Other servers are also available. For instance, Mozilla and Igalia delegates tend to use their own corporate homeservers. If you want to explore other servers, you can find many to choose from in the following lists:
        - https://www.hello-matrix.net/public_servers.php
        - https://publiclist.anchel.nl/

    1. Create your account

        Check the documentation for your preferred client. For most clients including Element, there should be a link to do this on the landing page when you're not already logged into another account.
